# Yahoo Finance Historical Price Movement Analyzer

This Python script makes a request to the Yahoo Finance API to collect historical price movements for a specific stock ticker. The script analyzes these movements and provides recommendations for the best times to buy or sell based on historical averages over a given period.

## Features
- Fetches historical price data for a specific ticker from Yahoo Finance.
- Analyzes the data and suggests the best times to buy or sell based on average price movements.
- Provides recommendations based on historical trends.

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the following:
1. **Yahoo Finance API Key**: You will need to generate an API key on [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/) to access the Yahoo Finance API.
2. **Required Python Modules**: The following Python modules are required for the script:
   - `requests`
   - `statistics`
   - `getpass`

   You can install the required modules using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

## Usage

### Step 1: Obtain an API Key
1. Visit [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/).
2. Sign up or log in to your account.
3. Search for "Yahoo Finance API" and subscribe to it.
4. After subscribing, you will receive an API key that you will use to authenticate requests.

### Step 2: Get the Ticker Symbol
You will need to know the correct symbol name for the stock or financial listing you're interested in. For reference, visit [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) to look up ticker symbols.

### Step 3: Running the Script
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Replace the `YOUR_API_KEY` placeholder in the script with your actual API key from RapidAPI.
3. Run the Python script.

```bash
python price_tracker.py
```

The script will prompt you to enter the ticker symbol (e.g., `AAPL` for Apple or `GOOG` for Google), and then it will fetch historical price data from Yahoo Finance. Afterward, the script will provide you with recommendations for the best times to buy or sell based on price trends.

## Example Output
```
Enter the ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, GOOG): AAPL
Fetching historical data for AAPL...
Best time to buy: 2023-01-10 (Price: $130.00)
Best time to sell: 2023-02-05 (Price: $150.00)
...
```

## Important Notes
- Ensure that you have a valid API key from RapidAPI to access the Yahoo Finance data.
- The script uses historical price movements and averages, but these recommendations do not guarantee future market performance. Always conduct your own research before making financial decisions.
